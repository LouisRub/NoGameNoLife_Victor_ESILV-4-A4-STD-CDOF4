The game of life implementation

# Overview
This project implements Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton simulation. The game consists of a grid of cells, each of which can be in one of two states: alive or dead. The game progresses in generations, with the state of each cell in a generation being determined by the states of its neighboring cells in the previous generation, following a set of rules.

# Rules of the Game
Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
